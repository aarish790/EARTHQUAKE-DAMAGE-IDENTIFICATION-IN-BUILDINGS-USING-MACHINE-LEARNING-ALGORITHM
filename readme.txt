There is a building structure which has 30 joints. 
 
At every joint there is an accelerometer attached, which gives the reading of earthquake sensed at that joint.

In this project I have used only three joints readings.

merged1 csv file consists of readings when joints are damaged due to the earthquake, Additional block consists of 2,3 and 4 is used to distinguish between the three joints.

merged2 csv file consists of readings in undamaged condition and damaged condition both, 0 is used for undamaged condition and 1 for damaged condition.

Random forest Regressor and ANN are used together to achieve the desired result.

Arbitary values were passed into both to check the result of both the algorithm.
