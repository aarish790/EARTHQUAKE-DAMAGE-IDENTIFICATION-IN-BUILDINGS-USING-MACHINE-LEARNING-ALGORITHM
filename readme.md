# EARTHQUAKE-DAMAGE-IDENTIFICATION-IN-BUILDINGS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHM

 The model identiﬁes condition of the building i.e whether it is damaged or undamaged, and if it is damaged then it identiﬁes which joint was damaged speciﬁcally.

## Structure Details

There is a building structure which has 30 joints. 
 
At every joint there is an accelerometer attached, which gives the reading of earthquake sensed at that joint.

Help regarding Project was taken from – Qatar University Grandstand Simulator                                                                                                            http://www.structuraldamagedetection.com/benchmark/qugs/


In this project I have used only three joints readings.

## Dataset Details

merged1 csv file consists of readings when joints are damaged due to the earthquake, Additional column in dataset consists of 2,3 and 4 which is used to distinguish between the three joints.

merged2 csv file consists of readings in undamaged condition and damaged condition both, 0 is used for undamaged condition of the joints and 1 for damaged condition of same joints 2,3,4

## Algorithms Used

Random forest Regressor and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) are used together to achieve the desired result.

For Detailed knowledge of Random forest Regressor refer to : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html .


For Detailed knowledge of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) refer to :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network .


Arbitary values were passed into both to check the result of both the algorithms.
